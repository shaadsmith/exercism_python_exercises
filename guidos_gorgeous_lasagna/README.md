Task 1:
Define an `EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME` constant that returns how many minutes the lasagna should bake in the oven. According to your cookbook, the Lasagna should be in the oven for 40 minutes

Task 2:
Implement the `bake_time_remaining()` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as an argument and returns how many minutes the lasagna still needs to bake based on the `EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME`.

Task 3:
Implement the `preparation_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers)` function that takes the number of layers you want to add to the lasagna as an argument and returns how many minutes you would spend making them. Assume each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare.

Task 4:
Implement the `elapsed_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers, elapsed_bake_time)` function that has two parameters: `number_of_layers` (the number of layers added to the lasagna) and `elapsed_bake_time` (the number of minutes the lasagna has been baking in the oven). This function should return the total number of minutes you've been cooking, or the sum of your preparation time and the time the lasagna has already spent baking in the oven.
